# Dotnet Runner

# *Running version < 4* - Auto update broken.
If anyone happens to be running a version lower than 0.0.4 then auto update is now broken. 
I borked setting up access token and essentially releases < 0.0.4 wont update. So instead manually download version 0.0.4 and installing will restore normal updates.

All part of the learning experience!

* ~~*Don't* expect any validation on user input.~~
