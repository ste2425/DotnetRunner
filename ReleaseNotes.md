# Copying logs to the clipboard

It is now possible to copy the entire log of a terminal to the systems clipboard. This also includes the selected text.

To copy only the selected text, first highlight the desired text then right click on the terminal.

To copy the entire log, select `Copy Log` from the drop down menu of each terminal.
